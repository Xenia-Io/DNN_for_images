**Deep Neural Networks for Image Classification and Segmentation problems**

This repository contains projects related to image segmentation and classification coupled with interactive Python notebooks. In particular, we utilise different Deep Neural Networks architectures to tackle important established problem in Computer Vision.

**1. Image Segmentation using MobileNetV2:**

The goal of this project is to perform pixel-level classification on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 (CUB-200) image dataset with photos of 200 bird species from Tensorflow Datasets package.
